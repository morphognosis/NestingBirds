# Nesting birds with morphognosis causation learning and control.

In this project, the Morphognosis and Mona neural network models are combined to
build a comprehensive model for animal learning and behavior.
Mona features a contextual causation learning model with goal-directed motivation.
Mophognosis features a contextual multilayer perceptron (MLP) model.

A pair of cooperating nest-building and foraging birds are used as a vehicle to demonstrate
the model. See: http://tom.portegys.com/research.html#mona2
