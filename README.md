# Nesting birds with goal-directed behavior using contextual causation learning.

In this project, the Morphognosis and Mona neural network models are combined into
Mandala, a comprehensive model for animal learning and behavior.
Mona features a contextual causation learning with goal-directed motivation.
Mophognosis features contextual multilayer perceptron (MLP).

A pair of cooperating nest-building and foraging birds are used as a vehicle to demonstrate
the model. See: http://tom.portegys.com/research.html#mona2
