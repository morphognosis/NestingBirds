# Nesting birds.

Abstract:

An animal behavior problem in the form of a game is proposed that involves two cooperating birds, a male and female. 
The female builds a nest
in to which she lays an egg. The male's job is to forage in a forest for food for both himself and the 
female. In addition, the male must fetch stones from a nearby desert for the female to use as nesting material. 
The game is complete when the nest is built and an egg is laid in it. The game can be run in three modes: manual
(user-supplied responses), "auto pilot" (self-playing), and using the bird's brain (supplied by a player).
